# GRAPE: Guiding RML Authoring with a Projectional Editor

[//]: # (--8<-- [start:features])

This prototype aims to enhance **authoring of RML mappings** by providing a _projectional editor_ (also known as _structural editing_) for RML mapping documents using JetBrains MPS. 

It offers:

- Turtle: to represent any RDF data.
- RML: to represent mappings embedded in Turtle files.
    - RML-Core: fully implemented
    - RML-FNML: function execution in expression
    - RML-IO: logical source and source
- Import/Export of mapping files
- Run mappings with the BURP engine
- Balance between guidance and freedom of editing
