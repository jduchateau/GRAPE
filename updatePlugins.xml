## Features

This demo project aims to enhance the authoring of RML mappings by providing a structural editor for RDF files using JetBrains MPS. 

It offers:
- Turtle: to represent any RDF data.
- RML: to represent mappings, embedded in Turtle files.
    - RML-Core: fully implemented
    - RML-FNML: function execution in expression
    - RML-IO: logical source and source

The goal is to create an extensible framework that:
- Serves as a middle ground between purely textual, form-based, and fully graphical or block-based editors.
- Makes working with RDF data more intuitive and enjoyable.
